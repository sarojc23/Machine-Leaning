# Machine Learning Coursework


During my doctoral studies in the Computer Science department, I completed a comprehensive coursework portfolio focused on machine learning. This collection of assignments and projects showcases my proficiency in various machine learning techniques and methodologies. You can explore the coursework repository here.

Overview of Coursework:

Week 1 Homework: Classification Performance Comparison
In this assignment, I compared the classification performance of linear regression and k-nearest neighbor classification using the zipcode dataset. This involved rigorous data preprocessing, model implementation, and performance evaluation.

Week 2 Homework: Linear Regression and Model Evaluation
I delved into the Boston Housing dataset to construct a linear regression model predicting median house value (medv) based on socioeconomic status. Through statistical analysis and model evaluation, I gained insights into feature significance and model performance metrics.

Week 4 Homework: Handling Class Imbalance
Exploring strategies for class imbalance, I implemented techniques like stratified sampling, oversampling, and undersampling on the default dataset. Utilizing logistic regression models, I evaluated their performance on various training sets to address class imbalance effectively.

Week 9 Homework: Neural Network Implementation
I embarked on a journey through neural networks, implementing a custom neural network class using Python and Numpy arrays. This implementation was applied to train on the MNIST dataset, and I reported test accuracy and confusion matrices to assess model performance.

Week 10 Homework: RNN Model Evaluation
Assessing an RNN model's performance in predicting Bitcoin price movements, I scrutinized the project's implementation to identify any potential discrepancies or flaws, thereby honing my skills in evaluating complex machine learning models.

Midterm and Final Projects: Practical Applications
Engaged in both midterm and final projects, I applied machine learning techniques to solve real-world problems. From project proposals to report submissions and code implementation, these projects provided invaluable hands-on experience in tackling diverse machine learning challenges.

This coursework portfolio reflects my dedication to mastering machine learning concepts and methodologies, equipped me with the skills necessary to excel in data analysis, predictive modeling, and solving complex real-world problems.
